# Practical WingChun - Training Journal 
The second project of my Software Engineering Immersive Course at General Aseembly. The goal is to build a full stack application where users are able to create their personal training journal and share it with other students within the school.<br/>

The below are the criteria set out by the course that I will need to meet:
### Technical Requirements
The app that I am building must:
- Have at least 2 resources(tables) (more if they make sense) â€“ one representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
- Include sign up/log in functionality(if they make sense), with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
- Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE
- Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process
- Have semantically clean HTML and CSS
- Be deployed online and accessible to the public


### Necessary Deliverables (Minimum Viable Product)
- A working full-stack application, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your GitHub repo
- A git repository hosted on GitHub, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit early, commit often.
- A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
- Wireframes of your app, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme (photos of your sketches on paper or whiteboard are fined)
- A link in your readme.md to the publically-accessible planning diagrams (eg. ER diagrams)
