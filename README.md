# Practical WingChun - Instructor Journal
The second project of my Software Engineering Immersive Course at General Aseembly. My idea for this app is directly related to one of my hobbies. I am one of many instructors at my martial arts school and the school is run on multiple locations throughout Queensland on different days.<br/> 
So the aim for this app is to allow the users(all instructors) to be able to plan, post and share what happens in the classes with the rest of the leadership group. <br/>

The below are the criteria set out by the course that I will need to meet:
### Technical Requirements
The app that I am building must:
- Have at least 2 resources(tables) (more if they make sense) â€“ one representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
- Include sign up/log in functionality(if they make sense), with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
- Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE
- Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process
- Have semantically clean HTML and CSS
- Be deployed online and accessible to the public


### Necessary Deliverables (Minimum Viable Product)
- A working full-stack application, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your GitHub repo
- A git repository hosted on GitHub, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit early, commit often.
- A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
- Wireframes of your app, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme (photos of your sketches on paper or whiteboard are fine)
- A link in your readme.md to the publically-accessible planning diagrams (eg. ER diagrams)


Extras
- Ability to upload images from user's computer/phone
- A library of drills/exercises that the user can choose from to plan their classes.
- Users can create their own drills
- Create admin permissions

### General Plan

I like to start off all projects with pen and paper. I think it lets me be more free and less constrained to ideas. 

Use the Problem Solving Process framework to break down the project into manageable components. From Technical Requirements & Necessary Deliverables
